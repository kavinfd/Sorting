Quicksort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an efficient sorting algorithm,
serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order.
When implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors,
merge sort and heapsort.

Type: Comparison sort  "meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a 'less-than'
                        relation (formally, a total order) is defined."

Average Case performance    : O(n log n)
Worst Case performance      : O(n2)
Best Case performance       : O(n log n) (simple partition)
                            : O(n) (three-way partition and equal keys)
Worst Case Space Complexity : O(n) auxiliary (naive)
                              O(log n) auxiliary (Sedgewick 1978)
Approach : Divide and conquer

Algorithm :

    The steps are:

        1 - Pick an element, called a pivot, from the array.
        2 - Reorder the array so that all elements with values less than the pivot come
            before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than the pivot come
            after it (equal values can go either way).
            After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position.
            This is called the partition operation.
        3 - Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements with smaller values
            and separately to the sub-array of elements with greater values.
