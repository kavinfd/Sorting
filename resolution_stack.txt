## resolved

## why some times O(log n) space taking algorithms called inplace
    1 - quick sort takes O(log n) stack space while recursion but it is actually accepted as an inplace algorithm

## Algorithms that are considered inplace
    1 - requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting. and results in sorted array being in its
        original place
